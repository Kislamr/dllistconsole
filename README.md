=============

My C# take on the doubly linked list.

The list is sorted, so every value that is added will be placed correctly into the list.

Basically the doubly linked list is a chain of elements whereas each element contains
a value and points to a previous and next element. The head's previous element heads to null.

If you have any improvements, please give it your best shot.
